# Goober

Goober is an open-source puzzle game written in Rust using [Piston](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston) and [ncollide](https://github.com/sebcrozet/ncollide).

## How to Play

In Goober, you will need to plan out your moves ahead of time, and then watch them be carried out by your little goobs. Commands can be given using the following keys:

| Key    | Command               |
|--------|-----------------------|
| A      | Spawn a new goob      |
| Space  | Switch between goobs  |
| Arrows | Move the current goob |

Once you are satisfied with the orders you've given your goobs, hit _Enter_ to submit them and watch them go.
